This year, I had a realization that gave me a new perspective on life. For most of my 46 years, I’ve felt like I was just going through the motions—working, living, but not really stepping into something that felt truly meaningful.

For years, my mother, now 79, only asked one thing of me: to drive her for her construction business. That’s all she needed—just driving. And honestly, I thought that’s all I could offer.

But this year, something changed. For the first time, I started working with her, truly becoming a part of her business. It wasn’t just driving anymore—I was learning from her, helping her, and growing alongside her. At 79, she’s still going strong, leading her company with passion and purpose.

It made me think of the story of Moses. Before he became a leader, he spent years as a shepherd, doing humble, quiet work. Those years might have seemed small, but they were preparing him for something bigger. Maybe my years of driving were like that, quietly shaping me for this new beginning.

Now I see it clearly: our lives can begin anew at any age. Whether we’re 46, like me, or 79, like my mother, there’s always time to start something meaningful. It’s not too late to find purpose, to build connections, and to realize that life is still full of possibility.

So if you ever feel like your best days are behind you, remember this: every day is a chance to begin again.
